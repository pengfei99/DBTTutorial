In this tutorial, we will show how to use dbt to do some data transformation

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What is dbt?
Dbt is a tool which is designed to solve for the T part of ETL, by working on raw data already present in a data 
warehouse.

In recent years, Data warehouses have become extremely flexible(UDFs,etc) and powerful. Features like separation 
of storage and processing, elastic scaling and Machine Learning capabilities(Bigqueryâ€™s ML) led many companies to 
use the data warehouse to perform the data transformation and load part of the ETL process (otherwise know as ELT). 

As **dbt provides an easy, version controlled way of writing transformations using just SQL, and data quality check 
natively**, dbt become very popular.
